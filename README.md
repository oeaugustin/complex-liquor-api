# complex-liquor-api
this an application that usars can enter their favorite spirits and get info and history on it as well as a list of cocktail recipes

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, AJAX

I used two separate ajax calls. I made a function declaration for the spirit api and called back on that function in the cocktail api request

## Lessons Learned:

It was the first time I took the data from one API and used in a request from another API
